Worksheet 6 - Data Exploration and Plotting with ggplot2 - *Answers*
========================================================

One of the most challenging parts of R is reading in your data. For spreadsheet applications, I find that comma deliminated data, .csv is the most useful format. Try out your import skills by downloading the mammal data into excel: https://github.com/bw4sz/2013-10-09-canberra/tree/master/data. Easiest way is to right click on "raw"", and hit 'save as' and save it locally. This file gives the ages of extinct mammal taxa. 

Data Exploration
-----------------
> 1. Read in the file

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("C:/Users/Mike/Desktop/Dropbox/R_course/data/mammals.csv")
```

> 2. How many records are in the data
```{r}
nrow(dat)
```
> 3. Using a contingency table, how many records are there for the family Cervidae

```{r}
table(dat$Family)
```

There are three extinct Cervidae species

> 4. How many familes are in the data? **Hint:** use length and table.

```{r}
length(table(dat$Family))
```

Subsetting
-------

> 5. Create a smaller dataframe for just extinct beavers (Castoridae)

```{r}
Cast <- dat[dat$Family=="Castoridae",]
```

> 6. When was the first beaver species present in the fossil record?

```{r}
d <- which.min(Cast$First_appearance_mya)
paste(d,"Million Years Ago")
```

Plotting
----

> 7. Make a boxplot of the range of species Last appearance dates by Order (for your interest add + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) to turn the names sideways)

```{r}
require(ggplot2)

ggplot(dat,aes(x=Order_or_higher,y=Last_appearance_mya)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

> 8. Using your beaver subset data create a scatterplot showing the relationship between mass and first appearance in the fossil record.

```{r}
ggplot(Cast,aes(x=Mass_ln_g,y=First_appearance_mya)) + geom_point()
```

> 9. Add a smoothing line to this data using geom_smooth. Explore the method="" arguments, what is the default? How would you make the smoothing line linear? Use the help screen and google. 

```{r}
ggplot(Cast,aes(x=Mass_ln_g,y=First_appearance_mya)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
ggplot(Cast,aes(x=Mass_ln_g,y=First_appearance_mya)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

> 10 BONUS. Create a plot showing the time in existance (hint:ymin=?,ymax=?) for each species of extinct beaver. Color by mass. Make it legible using themes, scale_color_continious, and labels.

```{r,dpi=100,fig.width=8}
ggplot(Cast,aes(ymin=First_appearance_mya,ymax=Last_appearance_mya,x=Species,col=Mass_ln_g)) + geom_linerange(size=3) + scale_y_reverse() + coord_flip() + scale_color_continuous(high="red",low="blue") + ylab("Mya") + xlab("Species")
```
