Worksheet 4 - Loops and Flow Statements 
======================================

In class we explored basic loop structures.

Loops and Outputs
----------------

Often the hardest task is not the computation, but controlling the data structure of outputing the loop. Try these variants:

> 1. Create a for loop from 1:100 that sticks x * 2 into a list
> 2. Create a for loop from 1:100 that sticks x * 2 into a vector
> 3. Create a for loop from 1:100 that sticks x * 2 into a dataframe, with the first column as x. 
> 4. Create a for loop that skips odd rows in the dataframe using next, don't cheat when using the seq statement iterator. 


Using user defined functions within a loop.
----------------
We'll be getting into user-defined functions in the next section, so here is a preview to the topic.

This is a generic function for finding prime numbers, 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

*The function is a bit slow, so don't go too high!*



```r
sieve <- function(n) {
    n <- as.integer(n)
    if (n > 1e+06) 
        stop("n too large")
    primes <- rep(TRUE, n)
    primes[1] <- FALSE
    last.prime <- 2L
    for (i in last.prime:floor(sqrt(n))) {
        primes[seq.int(2L * last.prime, n, last.prime)] <- FALSE
        last.prime <- last.prime + min(which(primes[(last.prime + 1):n]))
    }
    which(primes)
}

# Test
paste(sieve(10), "is prime")
```

```
## [1] "2 is prime" "3 is prime" "5 is prime" "7 is prime"
```


> 5. How many prime numbers are below 50?
> 6. How many prime numbers are below 50, but above 10?

Now for the loops.

> 7. Plot the number of prime numbers from 0 to 1000, by intervals of 100. 
> 8. Break the loop when the number of primes is greater than 100.
